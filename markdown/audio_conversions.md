# Working with audio files

There’s a good python library for manipulating audio called
[pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub).
It’s open source, MIT licensed, and has been around for years.

pydub represents audio with an object called an `AudioSegment`.
From an `AudioSegment` it’s possible to convert audio to and from
different forms.
