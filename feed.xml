        <h3 id="markov_chain">First order sequence model</h3>
        <p>
          We can set aside matrices for a minute and get back to what
          we really care about, sequences of words. Imagine that as we
          start to develop our natural language computer interface
          we want to handle just three possible commands:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Show me my directories please</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Show me my files please</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Show me my photos please</em>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Our vocabulary size is now seven:<br>
          {<em>directories, files, me, my, photos, please, show</em>}.
        </p>
        <p>
          One useful way to represent sequences is with a transition model.
          For every word in the vocabulary, it shows what the next word
          is likely to be. If users ask about photos half
          the time, files 30% of the time, and directories the rest
          of the time, the transition model will look like this.
          The sum of the transitions away from any word will always add up
          to one.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Markov chain transition model"
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brohrer/blog_images/refs/heads/main/transformers/markov_chain.png"
            alt="Markov chain transition model"
            style="height: 250px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          This particular transition model is called a
          <strong>Markov chain</strong>,
          because it satisfies the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property">
            Markov property</a>
          that the probabilities for the next word depend only on
          recent words. More specifically, it is a first order
          Markov model because it only looks at the single most recent word.
          If it considered the two most recent words it would be
          a second order Markov model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our break from matrices is over. It turns out that
          Markov chains can be expressed conveniently in matrix form.
          Using the same indexing scheme that we used when creating one-hot
          vectors, each row represents one of the words in our vocabulary.
          So does each column. The matrix transition model
          treats a matrix as a lookup table. Find the row
          that corresponds to the word youâ€™re interested in. The value in
          each column shows the probability of that word coming next.
          Because the value of each element in the matrix represents
          a probability, they will all fall between zero and one.
          Because probabilities always sum to one, the values in each
          row will always add up to one.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Transition matrix"

            alt="Transition matrix"
            style="height: 300px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          In the transition matrix here we can see the structure
          of our three sentences clearly. Almost all of the transition
          probabilities are zero or one. There is only one place in
          the Markov chain where branching happens. After <em>my</em>,
          the words <em>directories</em>, <em>files</em>, or <em>photos</em>
          might appear, each with a different probability. Other than that,
          thereâ€™s no uncertainty about which word will come next.
          That certainty is reflected by having mostly ones and zeros in the
          transition matrix.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can revisit our trick of using matrix multiplication
          with a one-hot vector to pull out the transition probabilities
          associated with any given word. For instance, if we just wanted
          to isolate the probabilities of which word comes after <em>my</em>,
          we can create a one-hot vector representing the word <em>my</em>
          and multiply it by our transition matrix. This pulls out
          the relevant row and shows us the probability distribution
          of what the next word will be.

        <h3 id="matrix_multiplication">Matrix multiplication</h3>
        <p>
          The dot product is the building block of matrix multiplication,
          a very particular way to combine a pair of two-dimensional arrays.
          We'll call the first of these matrices <em>A</em> and the second
          one <em>B</em>.
          In the simplest case, when <em>A</em> has only one row and
          <em>B</em> has only one column, the result of matrix multiplication
          is the dot product of the two.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="multiplication of a single row matrix and a single column matrix"
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brohrer/blog_images/refs/heads/main/transformers/matrix_mult_one_row_one_col.png"
            alt="multiplication of a single row matrix and a single column matrix"
            style="height: 300px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice how the number of columns in <em>A</em> and the number of
          rows in <em>B</em> needs to be the same for the two arrays
          to match up and for the dot product to work out.
        </p>
        <p>
          When <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> start to grow, matrix multiplication
          starts to get trippy. To handle more than one row in <em>A</em>,
          take the dot product of <em>B</em> with each row separately.
          The answer will have as many rows as <em>A</em> does.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="multiplication of a two row matrix and a single column matrix"
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brohrer/blog_images/refs/heads/main/transformers/matrix_mult_two_row_one_col.png"
            alt="multiplication of a two row matrix and a single column matrix"
            style="height: 250px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          When <em>B</em> takes on more columns, take the dot product of
          each column with <em>A</em> and stack the results in successive
          columns.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="multiplication of a one row matrix and a two column matrix"
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brohrer/blog_images/refs/heads/main/transformers/matrix_mult_one_row_two_col.png"
            alt="multiplication of a one row matrix and a two column matrix"
            style="height: 250px;">
        </p>
        <p>
         Now we can extend this to mutliplying any two matrices, as long as
         the number of columns in <em>A</em> is the same as the number of
         rows in <em>B</em>. The result will have the same
         number of rows as <em>A</em> and the same number of columns as
         <em>B</em>.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="multiplication of a three row matrix and a two column matrix"
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brohrer/blog_images/refs/heads/main/transformers/matrix_mult_three_row_two_col.png"
            alt="multiplication of a one three matrix and a two column matrix"
            style="height: 450px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          If this is the first time you're seeing this, it might
          feel needlessly complex, but I promise it pays off later.
        </p>

        <h4 id="table_lookup">Matrix multiplication as a table lookup</h4>
        <p>
          Notice how matrix multiplication acts as a lookup table here.
          Our <em>A</em> matrix is made up of a stack of one-hot vectors.
          They have ones in the first column, the fourth column,
          and the third column, respectively. When we work through the
          matrix multiplication, this serves to pull out the first row,
          the fourth row, and the third row of the <em>B</em> matrix,
          in that order. This trick of using a one-hot vector to pull
          out a particular row of a matrix is at the core of how
          transformers work.

          <h3 id="dot_product">Dot product</h3>
        <p>
          One really useful thing about the one-hot representation is that
          it lets us compute
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot products</a>.
          These are also known by other
          intimidating names like inner product and scalar product.
          To get the dot product of two vectors, multiply their
          corresponding elements, then add the results.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Dot product illustration"
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brohrer/blog_images/refs/heads/main/transformers/dot_product.png"
            alt="Dot product illustration"
            style="height: 300px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          Dot products are especially useful when we're working with our
          one-hot word representations. The dot product of any one-hot
          vector with itself is one.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Dot product of matching vectors"

            alt="Dot product of matching vectors"
            style="height: 300px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          And the dot product of any one-hot vector with any other one-hot
          vector is zero.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Dot product of non-matching vectors"

            style="height: 300px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          The previous two examples show how dot products
          can be used to measure similarity. As another example,
          consider a vector of values that represents a combination of words
          with varying weights.
          A one-hot encoded word can be compared against it with the
          dot product
          to show how strongly that word is represented.

    <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Behind all the GPTs and Geminis and Claudes and Llamas are transformers. They were introduced as a tool for sequence transductionâ€”converting one sequence of symbols to anotherâ€”and are now used almost entirely for sequence completionâ€”given a starting prompt, carry on in the same vein and style.
</p>
<p>
Here is a deep dive into the nuts and bolts of what make them tick. This isn't a short journey, but I hope you'll be glad you came.
</p>

<h2>One-hot encoding</h2>
<p>
In the beginning were the words. So very many words. Our first step is to convert all the words to numbers so we can do math on them.
</p>
<p>
Imagine that our goal is to create the computer that responds to our voice commands. Itâ€™s our job to build the transformer that converts (or transduces) a sequence of sounds to a sequence of words.
</p>
<p>
We start by choosing our vocabulary, the collection of symbols that we are going to be working with in each sequence. In our case, there will be two different sets of symbols, one for the input sequence to represent vocal sounds and one for the output sequence to represent words.
</p>
<p>
For now, let's assume we're working with English. There are tens of thousands of words in the English language, and perhaps another few thousand to cover computer-specific terminology. That would give us a vocabulary size that is the better part of a hundred thousand. One way to convert words to numbers is to start counting at one and assign each word its own number. Then a sequence of words can be represented as a list of numbers.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider a tiny language with a vocabulary size of three: files, find, and my. Each word could be swapped out for a number, perhaps files = 1, find = 2, and my = 3. Then the sentence "Find my files", consisting of the word sequence [ find, my, files ] could be represented instead as the sequence of numbers [2, 3, 1].
</p>
<p>
This is a perfectly valid way to convert symbols to numbers, but it turns out that there's another format that's even easier for computers to work with, one-hot encoding. In one-hot encoding a symbol is represented by an array of mostly zeros, the same length of the vocabulary, with only a single element having a value of one. Each element in the array corresponds to a separate symbol.
</p>
<p>

Another way to think about one-hot encoding is that each word still gets assigned its own number, but now that number is an index to an array. Here is our example above, in one-hot notation.
</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="A one-hot encoded vocabulary"
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brohrer/blog_images/refs/heads/main/transformers/one_hot_vocabulary.png"
            alt="A one-hot encoded vocabulary"
            style="height: 300px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          So the sentence "Find my files" becomes a sequence of one-dimensional
          arrays,
          which, after you squeeze them together,
          starts to look like a two-dimensional array.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="A one-hot encoded sentence"
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brohrer/blog_images/refs/heads/main/transformers/one_hot_sentence.png"
            alt="A one-hot encoded sentence"
            style="height: 300px;">
        </p>

<p>
So the sentence "Find my files" becomes a sequence of one-dimensional arrays, which, after you squeeze them together, starts to look like a two-dimensional array.
</p>
<p>
Heads-up, I'll be using the terms "one-dimensional array" and "vector" interchangeably. Likewise with "two-dimensional array" and "matrix".
