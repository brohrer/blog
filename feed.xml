      <![CDATA[
        <p>
          For fun, I take something trivial, like my blog, and try to make it
          as robust to failure as possible. Among other things, I host it
          on three different git services, Github, GitLab, and Codeberg.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the repository supporting my blog has grown, mainly from collecting
          images, it got larger than the politely enforced 100MB limit of
          Codeberg. It also made it impossible to ignore that I was abusing
          git, using it to version control binaries that don't change often.
          I am using it as a file store, in addition to tracking changes in
          my html and css.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get around this, I broke my website repo out into two - one is
          a proper version control hosting the code, which I creatively named
          "blog". And the other is a blatant file store for images,
          named "blog_images". Although I'm still abusing it, separating it
          out is the first step toward moving to a proper file store.
          Now both repos are under the 100MB limit, and I can host them
          in triplicate if one service goes down or gets shut down for some
          reason, I can quickly migrate to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also made the deliberate decision to use GitHub as a content
          delivery network. All my image links go right to the raw
          images on GitHub now.
          I occasionally bump up against my free bandwidth
          limits at Netlify. By serving my images from GitHub, that bandwidth
          will go down to a tiny fraction of what it was.
          It's terrible ettiquette to use a git service as a CDN and I 
          would never do this Codeberg, a respectable small scale operation.
          But GitHub won't even see this as a rounding error at 6 decimal
          places, and plus...it's Microsoft.
